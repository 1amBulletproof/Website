##Github Flavored Markdown
1. GFM ignores underscores (use a \* instead of \_)
2. Strikethrough style allowed ~~like this~~
3. [x] Task List
4. [ ] Wish I had this done...
5. Auto-hotlinking
6. Fenced codeblocks
7. Tables

Tabs should display as code but this function doesn't work here.

```
<h2>This is definitely code</h2>
```
